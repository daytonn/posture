# Posture
If you like your Backbone, you'll want Posture.

## Run project locally
1. ```git clone https://github.com/daytonn/posture.git```
2. ```bower install```

To see the specs run, open index.html.

Note: you may have to tell your browser to allow local files to access other local files. On a Mac with Chrome this looks like this:

```open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args  --allow-file-access-from-files```

You can check out an example by opening ```examples/tabs.html```.
